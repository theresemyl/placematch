# üçΩÔ∏è PlaceMatch

PlaceMatch is a full-stack web app that lets you swipe on local restaurants with a friend to find your next place to eat, from anywhere in the world.

On the front-end, the project uses React and the Google Maps/Places API.

On the back-end, the project uses Node, Express, MySQL, and Knex.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Use npm install to install node modules for client and server-side.

```bash
cd client
npm install

cd server
npm install
```

Create tables for the users, likes, and matches tables. Running seed data is optional as it is only sample data for a few users and likes.
You'll be able to sign up and add users to the database on the client-side once the project is up and running.

```bash
knex migrate:latest
knex seed:run
```

On the client-side `package.json`, add your localhost server to the proxy, for example:

```
"proxy": "http://localhost:8080"
```

On the server-side `.env` file, add your proxy and jwt_secret, for example:

```
PORT=8080
JWT_SECRET=hello
```

Run `npm start` to run the project on your browser.

## üîë Required API Key

This project requires you to create your own API key from the

After registering your API key, enter it in the client-side `.env` file, for example:

```
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_API_KEY=apikeyhere
